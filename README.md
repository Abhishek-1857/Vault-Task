# Vault-Task

This is Vault contract which is replicated from Solidity Vault contract. I have hardcode and skipped some thing in the contracts which was Ivaultutils,Ivault, IvaultPricefeed interfaces which was not present in cosmwasm so to use the.. we have to create them so for the task i have hardcoded some values to zero or skipped them and provided the comments for the same.. These will be present in some function. Also two function called `get_max_price` and `get_min_price` i have returned there value zero which is hardcoded as these funcions were also using above interfaces.
